### Genmax

Genmax is a simple code generation tool.

#### Key Components

- Projects

Genmax organizes all files and content in projects. Every project has itown folder. Genmax projects can be created in any folder.

- Flows

Genmax projects have flows to group together multiple files to be generated. Flows are in **yml** format.

- Data

You can pass data to templates that help generate data. For example, you can dynamically pass the name of attributes if you are generating a class file.

- Templates

These templates form the basis of the code to be generated. Genmax uses the Jinja2 engine for code generation.

- Output

Once the data is passed to a template, Genmax generates an output file with the generated code. For nested output locations, you can use **>** as a separator.
